            Text="Prepare the base: Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. SautÃ© for about 5 minutes until softened. Brown the meat: Add ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spoon. Drain excess fat if necessary. Build the sauce: Stir in tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, and beef broth (or wine). Add oregano, basil, bay leaf, sugar, salt, and pepper. Simmer: Reduce heat to low, cover, and let the sauce simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the better the flavor."
